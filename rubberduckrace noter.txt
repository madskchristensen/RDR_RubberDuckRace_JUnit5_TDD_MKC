N Queues
N Unique Numbered Rubber Ducks
Time step 1, 2 ...


10 queues of 10 ducks = 100 unique numbered ducks in the race


For each time step
----
1. Draw number between 1 - N
   Move foremost rubber duck from that queue to new queue with help of another new random number

2. One less queue, with 1 less room


SIMULATION

-- Time Step 1
10 Queues with 10 ducks each
= 100 ducks total

First random between 1 - N (10) = 7
Second random between 1 - N (10) = 3
getForemostRubberDuckFromQueue7 -> addRubberDuckToEndOfQueue3

-- Time Step 2
9 Queues with 9 ducks each
= 81 ducks total

-- Time Step 3
8 Queues with 8 ducks each
= 64 ducks total

-- Time step 4
7 Queues with 7 ducks each
= 49 ducks total

-- Time step 5
6 queues with 6 ducks each
= 36 ducks total

-- Time step 6
5 queues with 5 ducks each
= 25 ducks total

- Time step 7
4 queues with 4 ducks each
= 16 ducks total

-- Time step 8
3 Queues with 3 ducks each
=  9 ducks total

-- Time step 9
2 Queues with 2 ducks each
= 4 ducks total

-- Time step 10
1 Queue with 1 duck
= 1 duck total (WINNER)
